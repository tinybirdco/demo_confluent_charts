If you're building a SaaS product, you need insights, and a way to share them. They might show resource usage, performance metrics, or other data that's relevant to the service you're providing. Whatever the data, users want to see fresh data, not yesterday's, and they don't want to wait for slow metrics and charts. This projects shows how to build a real-time e-commerce analytics dashboard with cool charts that's fast, scalable, and easy to maintain using Tinybird, plus how to integrate it with a Next.js frontend.
